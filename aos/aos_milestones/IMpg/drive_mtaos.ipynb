    "# Integration Milestone pg: AOS using ComCam, commanding MT \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>Warning:</b> This notebooks was designed and executed at NTS. It may not work \"as-is\" in different environments, especially at the summit. It may also stop working at NTS if any of the underlying data changes. In case of problems contact the author for support.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to execute Integration Milestone pg (IMpg).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task consist of the following step:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Enabling the MTAOS with the configuration designed for the test.\n",
    " This configuration mainly points the MTAOS to read data from a local butler for wich simulated intra/extra focal data for ComCam was previously ingested.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Send the command `runWEP` specifying the `visitId` and `extraId`, which will cause the MTAOS to process the data in the background using the wavefront estimation pipeline.\n",
    " \n",
    "   If this is the first time data is processed this command can take quite a while to execute (a bit over 10 minutes in most times I executed it).\n",
    " \n",
    "   If the data was already processed, the MTAOS will use the results from the butler and mainly republish the events with the information and configure the internal model to apply the correction.\n",
    " \n",
    "   At this point we don't have a good mechanism that would cause the MTAOS to reprocess a previously processed data.\n",
    "   One option is to delete the \"run\" from the butler.\n",
    " \n",
    "   To do this execute the following command in a terminal in nublado:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   butler prune-collection /project/tribeiro/IMpg/data/im9-ppg-w_2021_20/ mtaos_wep --purge --unstore\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   A couple things to note on the command above. \n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The path `/project/tribeiro/IMpg/data/im9-ppg-w_2021_20/` is the location of the butler instance.\n",
    "       This is enconded in the MTAOS configuration mentioned above.\n",
    "    2. The string `mtaos_wep` is the name of the run.\n",
    "       This is also part of the CSC configuration but, in this case, it is the default value used by the MTAOS.\n",
    "    3. The CSC has access to a shared space (e.g. `/project`) which contains a butler instance with data from the camera and also user-defined butler instances, as the one used in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Send the command `runOFC` to the MTAOS.\n",
    "    This command makes the MTAOS process the wavefront errors generated by `runWEP` and compute the corrections for each component; Camera Hexapod, M2 Hexapod, M2 and M1M3.\n",
    " 4. Finally, issue the corrections to the components by executing the `issueCorrection` command.\n",
    " \n",
    "Analysis of the outputs is done on a separate notebook (`check_impg_run.ipynb`).\n"
